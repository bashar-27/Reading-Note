## Data Transfer Objects in C#

### What Is a DTO?
A DTO (Data Transfer Object) is an object that defines how data will be sent between applications.
It’s used only to send and receive data and does not contain in itself any business logic.

A Data Transfer Object (DTO) is a design pattern in computer software architecture used to transfer data between systems or between the layers of a software application. It is an object that carries data between processes in a serializable format, allowing the data to be passed along a communication channel, such as over a network connection. A DTO typically contains data members and transfers the data between a software application’s presentation layer and the business layer. The goal is to keep the data separate from the system’s behavior and reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred, which can improve performance and reduce the risk of data corruption.
DTOs provide a layer of abstraction that helps to isolate the client-side code from the underlying data structure, enabling you to easily change the data structure without affecting the client-side code.

## Reasons to Use DTOs
DTOs help you with the following:

Data Abstraction: DTOs provide a level of abstraction between the client-side code and the underlying data structure, which makes it easier to modify the data structure without affecting the client-side code.
Improved Performance: By only transferring the necessary information, DTOs can significantly improve the performance of web APIs. This is because they reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred, which can reduce network traffic and improve the overall response time of the API.
Increased Security: By only returning the necessary information, DTOs can help to reduce the risk of exposing sensitive information to the client.
Interoperability: DTOs make sharing data between different processes, threads, services, apps, and application layers easier.
Better maintainability: DTOs make it easier to maintain the code because they provide a clear separation of concerns between the client and the server.

## How to put a DTO to use
A DTO should just contain data, not business logic. It's a simple, small thing that should do one task only.

A good DTO will:

Minimize boilerplate. You'll write each one fresh.
Be easy to create. DTOs shouldn't be so complicated that you struggle to write them. (Code like this is easy to break.)
Be readable. Anyone should be able to parse your code.
