# ES6 Overview

**ES6, or ECMAScript 6**, revolutionized JavaScript with a plethora of new features and syntax improvements. It introduced concepts like arrow functions, classes, template literals, and block-scoped variables (`let` and `const`). These additions significantly enhanced the expressiveness and power of JavaScript.

ECMAScript 6, commonly known as ES6, is the sixth edition of the ECMAScript standard. It brought about a major transformation in JavaScript, equipping developers with a wealth of new features and syntax enhancements. This included powerful additions like arrow functions, which offer a concise way to define functions. The introduction of classes streamlined object-oriented programming in JavaScript. Template literals enabled easier string interpolation, while the `let` and `const` declarations provided better variable scope management. Altogether, ES6 elevated the language to a new level of expressiveness and functionality.



# React Concepts Overview

## JSX: 
JSX, an extension of JavaScript syntax, is a fundamental aspect of React development. It provides a way to describe UI elements in a format resembling HTML or XML. This makes the creation of React elements more intuitive and straightforward.

## Rendering Elements: 
Rendering elements in React involves the process of displaying a React element on the screen. These elements serve as the smallest building blocks of React applications, representing what users see on the screen. Once created, they remain immutable.

## Components & Props: 
React components are reusable, self-contained units of a UI. They can be combined to create more complex interfaces. Props, or properties, enable the dynamic passing of data from a parent component to a child component. This dynamic capability contributes to the flexibility and versatility of UI development.

## State & Lifecycle: 
State, a core concept in React, encapsulates the data that a component maintains. It can change over time, often in response to user interactions. Understanding how to manage state is pivotal for building interactive and responsive applications. Additionally, a component's lifecycle denotes the various phases it goes through, from initialization to destruction.

## Handling Events: 
Effectively handling events is essential in React development. This involves specifying how a component should respond to user interactions, such as clicks or keyboard input. Event handlers are functions that execute in response to events. React offers a streamlined and consistent approach to managing events across different browsers.
