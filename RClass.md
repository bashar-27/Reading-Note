# Graph Data Structure

A **Graph** is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. Vertices, sometimes referred to as nodes, are the fundamental units of the graph, and edges are the lines or arcs that connect any two nodes. Formally, a Graph is composed of a set of vertices (V) and a set of edges (E), denoted as G(V, E).

## Components of a Graph

- **Vertices**: Fundamental units of the graph, also known as nodes. Each node/vertex can be labeled or unlabelled.
- **Edges**: Connect two nodes of the graph. They can be ordered pairs in a directed graph. Edges can connect any two nodes in any possible way. They can be labeled or unlabelled.

## Types of Graphs

1. **Null Graph**: A graph with no edges.
2. **Trivial Graph**: Contains only a single vertex, the smallest possible graph.
3. **Undirected Graph**: Edges have no direction, i.e., nodes are unordered pairs in edge definitions.
4. **Directed Graph**: Edges have direction, nodes are ordered pairs in edge definitions.
5. **Connected Graph**: From any node, we can visit any other node in the graph.
6. **Disconnected Graph**: At least one node is not reachable from another node.
7. **Regular Graph**: Every vertex has the same degree (number of edges connected to it).
8. **Complete Graph**: There is an edge from each node to every other node.
9. **Cycle Graph**: Forms a cycle where every vertex has a degree of 2.
10. **Cyclic Graph**: Contains at least one cycle.
11. **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**: Contains no cycles.
12. **Bipartite Graph**: Vertices can be divided into two sets with no edges within a set.
13. **Weighted Graph**: Edges already have specified weights. Can be directed or undirected.

## Tree vs Graph

Trees are a restricted form of graphs with additional rules. While every tree is a graph, not all graphs are trees. Linked Lists, Trees, and Heaps are special cases of graphs.

## Representation of Graphs

There are two common ways to store a graph:

### Adjacency Matrix

In this method, the graph is represented as a 2D matrix where rows and columns represent vertices. Each entry in the matrix represents the weight of the edge between those vertices.

### Adjacency List

This representation uses a collection of linked lists. An array of pointers points to the edges connected to each vertex.

## Comparison between Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List

| Action           | Adjacency Matrix | Adjacency List |
|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Adding Edge      | O(1)            | O(1)          |
| Removing an Edge | O(1)            | O(N)          |
| Initializing     | O(N^2)          | O(N)          |

## Basic Operations on Graphs

1. **Insertion of Nodes/Edges**: Insert a node into the graph.
2. **Deletion of Nodes/Edges**: Delete a node from the graph.
3. **Searching on Graphs**: Search for an entity in the graph.
4. **Traversal of Graphs**: Traverse all the nodes in the graph.

## Usage of Graphs

- Representing maps for various services like finding the shortest path between two cities.
- Representing dependencies in tasks with Directed Acyclic Graphs and finding task execution order using topological sort.
- State Transition Diagrams for legal moves in games like tic-tac-toe.

## Real-Life Applications of Graphs

1. **Team Interactions Analysis**: Used to represent interactions between players on a team, providing insights into team dynamics.
2. **Social Networks**: Commonly used to represent networks of friends on social media platforms.
3. **Computer Networks**: Representing the topology of connections between routers and switches.
4. **Transportation Networks**: Representing connections between different places in a transportation network, like roads and airports.
5. **Neural Networks**: Understanding brain function and learning through synapses and neurons.
6. **Compilers**: Used for various purposes like type inference and data flow analysis in compilers.
7. **Robot Planning**: Planning paths for autonomous vehicles based on possible states.

## When to Use Graphs

- When relationships between different objects or entities need to be represented and analyzed.
- For network analysis, identifying key players, influencers, or bottlenecks.
- Making predictions or recommendations based on complex data relationships.
