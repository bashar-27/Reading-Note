<h1>Linked List</h1>

<h3>What is Linked List?</h3>

Linked List is a linear data structure, in which elements are not stored at a contiguous location, rather they are linked using pointers.
Linked List forms a series of connected nodes, where each node stores the data and the address of the next node.

Or 
Linked List can be defined as collection of objects called nodes that are randomly stored in the memory.
 

Type of linked list: 
There are mainly three types of linked lists:

1- Single-linked list

2- Double linked list

3- Circular linked list 

4- Linked List Complexity

<h3>Time Complexity</h3>

| Operation   | Worst Case | Average Case |
|-------------|------------|--------------|
| Search      | O(n)       | O(n)         |
| Insert      | O(1)       | O(1)         |
| Deletion    | O(1)       | O(1)         |
| Space Complexity | O(n)  |              |

<h3>Advantages of Linked Lists</h3>

* Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically, as memory allocation is done at runtime.
* Insertion and Deletion: Adding or removing elements from a linked list is efficient, especially for large lists.
* Flexibility: Linked lists can be easily reorganized and modified without requiring a contiguous block of memory.

<h3>Disadvantages of Linked Lists</h3>

* Random Access: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not allow direct access to elements by index. Traversal is required to reach a specific node.
* Extra Memory: Linked lists require additional memory for storing the pointers, compared to arrays.
