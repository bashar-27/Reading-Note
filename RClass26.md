<h2>MVC Basics</h2>
ASP.NET MVC is a modern design pattern that offers a more efficient approach to web application development compared to traditional ASP.NET. In ASP.NET, the user action and view are tightly coupled, while in MVC, the view only handles UI,
and user actions are defined in the controller. MVC is action-based, allowing the display of appropriate views based on actions, resulting in cleaner code organization. Unlike ASP.NET's heavy ViewState for state management, MVC doesn't use ViewState,
improving efficiency. MVC eliminates the concept of page life cycle, leading to faster response times by hitting the controller, collecting data from the model, and rendering it in the view. MVC's separation of layers—Model, View,
and Controller—enables easy testing and maintenance, enhancing software quality.
The Model layer defines application objects, Views are rendered using the Razor Engine, and Controllers handle requests and responses, all utilizing dynamic routing. MVC can be integrated with existing ASP.NET features, 
enhances reusability, and is suitable for both light-weight and large-scale applications.

<h2>Tag Helper</h2>
ag Helpers in ASP.NET Core are a powerful feature that allows developers to create and render HTML elements with server-side logic, providing a more natural and readable way to work with HTML in Razor views.
Tag Helpers essentially allow you to extend HTML syntax with server-side functionality.
