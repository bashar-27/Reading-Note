# Trees

A tree is a data structure made up of nodes or vertices and edges without having any cycle. The tree with no nodes is called the null or empty tree. A tree that is not empty consists of a root node and potentially many levels of additional nodes that form a hierarchy. | [Source](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)>)

## Terminology Summary

- `Root` is the topmost node of the tree
- `Edge` is the link between two nodes
- `Child` is a node that has a parent node
- `Parent` is a node that has an edge to a child node
- `Leaf` is a node that does not have a child node in the tree
- `Height` is the length of the longest path to a leaf
- `Depth` is the length of the path to its root

## Traversal Algorithms

### Breadth-First:

It starts at the tree root and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)

### Depth-First:

It starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. | [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
