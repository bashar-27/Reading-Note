# Razor Page

 Razor Page is a way to build web pages in ASP.NET Core that combines regular HTML with C# or VB.NET code. It's like having a single file where you can write the structure of your webpage and also add some programming logic if needed. 
 This makes it easy to create dynamic web pages without having to switch between different files or languages. Each Razor Page usually represents a specific part or feature of a website. It's designed to be straightforward and easy to understand, making it a great choice for building web applications.
 It also comes with built-in features that help developers work more efficiently, like handling data and routing. Overall, Razor Pages make it simple to create interactive and dynamic web pages while keeping the code organized.

 # Razor Page Vs MVC

 ## Razor Pages:

Like a Storybook: Imagine writing a storybook where each page tells a different part of the story. In Razor Pages, each page represents a different part of your website.

Easy to Start: It's like writing a simple diary. You write what you want, and it's all in one place. This makes it quick and easy to get started.

Good for Smaller Projects: If you're building a smaller website or something not too complex, Razor Pages can be like a simple, straightforward tool that gets the job done without extra fuss.

## MVC (Model-View-Controller):

Teamwork: Think of it like making a movie. You have different teams - one for the story (Model), one for how it looks (View), and one for directing and handling everything (Controller).

Lots of Control: It's like being a chef in a kitchen with many ingredients. You have complete control over every part, which is great for big, complex websites with many features.

Good for Big Projects: If you're building something large and complex, like a big e-commerce site with lots of different features, MVC gives you the tools to manage everything smoothly.
