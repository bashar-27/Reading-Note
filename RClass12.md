# MVC

## Goal of Entity Framework:
<p>The purpose of Entity Framework is to simplify and streamline the process of working with databases in .NET applications by providing an object-oriented approach to database interactions, eliminating the need for writing raw SQL queries, and enabling developers to focus on working with data as objects rather than dealing with low-level database operations.</p>

## MVC vs Razor Pages

**ASP.NET MVC** (Model-View-Controller) is a powerful web development framework provided by Microsoft that follows the MVC architectural pattern. It separates the application into three main components: the **model**, the **view**, and the **controller**.

In ASP.NET MVC:
- The model represents the application's data and business logic.
- The view is responsible for rendering the user interface.
- The controller handles user input, interacts with the model, and decides which view to present.

**Razor Pages**, on the other hand, is an alternative web development model provided by ASP.NET Core. It follows a simpler page-based programming model, combining the view and controller logic into a single file. This approach reduces ceremony and overhead compared to MVC.

The main differences between ASP.NET MVC and Razor Pages are:
- MVC emphasizes separation of concerns and strict responsibilities between models, views, and controllers. It is suitable for complex applications requiring extensive control over routing and different request types.
- Razor Pages promote a more straightforward and compact development model, ideal for small to medium-sized applications with fewer concerns about separation.

Choose the right approach based on your application's complexity and requirements:
- MVC provides more flexibility and control.
- Razor Pages offer a simpler and more concise approach.

## Seeding Data:
<p> Seeding data involves inserting predefined or default data into a database during the initial setup or migration process, establishing a foundation for the application's functionality and allowing it to operate with meaningful data from the start.</p>

## ASP.NET MVC application with EF

**ASP.NET MVC** combined with **Entity Framework** (EF) provides a powerful and structured approach to web development. Entity Framework is a popular ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool that simplifies database interactions in .NET applications.

With EF, you can:
- Define entity classes representing database tables.
- Utilize EF to generate SQL queries and perform CRUD operations on the database using object-oriented syntax.
- Establish relationships, specify data validations, and map entity properties to database columns.

In an ASP.NET MVC application with EF:
- The model component represents the application's data and business logic.
- EF facilitates interaction with the underlying database, enabling convenient definition and manipulation of database entities.

The controller component handles user requests, while the view component renders the user interface and displays data to the user. Both the controller and view can leverage EF to fetch and interact with data from the model.

By combining the benefits of MVC for separation of concerns and the convenience of EF for database interactions, you can build robust, scalable, and data-driven applications with ease.
