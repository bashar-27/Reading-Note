# Intro to View Components

View components in ASP.NET Core are powerful elements that render specific chunks of a webpage rather than the entire response. They offer similar separation-of-concerns and testability benefits as seen between controllers and views.
Unlike partial views, view components don't rely on model binding and instead depend on data passed when calling them. They can incorporate parameters and business logic, making them ideal for reusable rendering tasks that are too complex for partial views.
View components are typically invoked from a layout page and are well-suited for tasks like creating dynamic navigation menus, querying databases for tag clouds, or rendering elements like sign-in panels or shopping carts. 
They consist of a class, usually derived from ViewComponent, and the resulting view. While view components can be implemented as POCOs, leveraging the methods and properties available by deriving from ViewComponent is common practice.
When deciding between view components and Razor components, consider using the latter for client-side UI logic and composition. Razor components combine markup with C# code, enhancing developer productivity. 
To learn more about Razor components and how to integrate them into an MVC or Razor Pages app, refer to the ASP.NET Core Razor components documentation.

View Components in ASP.NET Core MVC are reusable components similar to partial views. They render specific parts of a webpage, offering separation of concerns and testability benefits like controllers and views. 
They are invoked from layout pages and handle complex rendering tasks that may be too intricate for partial views, such as dynamic navigation menus or tag clouds that query databases.

A View Component consists of a class derived from ViewComponent and the resulting view. It can have parameters and business logic, and is typically used for tasks like rendering sign-in panels, shopping carts, or recently published articles.

In ASP.NET Core MVC, developers can choose between using partial views or view components, depending on the specific requirements of the feature being implemented. Overall, View Components offer a powerful tool for creating reusable UI components in ASP.NET Core applications.
