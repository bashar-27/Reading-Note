# React - Conditional Rendering

Conditional rendering in React allows components to render different output based on specified conditions. By using JavaScript's conditional operators like `if` or the ternary operator, components can dynamically determine what to render, providing a dynamic user interface.

# React - Lists & Keys

Lists are a fundamental concept in React for rendering multiple items. They involve mapping over an array of data and rendering a component for each item. Keys are important for React to understand which items have changed, added, or removed. They provide a unique identifier to each element in the list.

# React - Forms

React provides a controlled component approach for handling forms. This means that form elements like input fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons are controlled by React's state. This allows React to have full control over the form's behavior and data.

# React - Lifting State

Lifting state in React involves moving the state of a component higher up in the component tree to be shared among multiple components. This allows different components to have access to the same state and ensures that any changes in one component are reflected in others.

# React - Composition vs Inheritance

Composition and inheritance are two different approaches to code reuse in React. Composition involves creating components that use other components for their functionality, while inheritance involves creating specialized components that extend the functionality of a base component. In React, composition is generally favored over inheritance for code reuse.
